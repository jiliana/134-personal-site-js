# Changes Made

#### 3rd Party Scripts
- Instagram (Feature #6)

#### Features

1. Project Cards
    - Before: Users must click the 'Take a closer look' text to navigate to the project's page
    - Now: Users can click anywhere on the project card to view the project's page
2. Added and finalized project pages
    - Composed content and visuals for [Portfolio Site](https://sensational-paletas-d35b97.netlify.app/projects/portfolio-site.html) and [Movie Match](https://sensational-paletas-d35b97.netlify.app/projects/movie-match.html) project pages. 
    - Includes: adding images to project cards, GIFS and embedded prototypes to project pages, project details
3. Animations
    - As users scroll down, the sections fade up into view
4. Contact Form Email Validation
    - Users are alerted if their email is invalid when submitting their form, and email is not sent
    - Email is sent if email is valid
5. Contact Form Formatting
    - Email's subject and body are formatted properly using user's input values
6. Embedded Instagram posts
    - I embedded 3 Instagram posts from my rabbit's Instagram page to showcase more of my personality!
7. Embedded Figma Interactive Prototype
    - I embedded a Figma prototype in my project page because it effectively presents my design prototype that users can interact with. This is the most important part of my case study since users can navigate through the prototype and analyze it effectively.
8. Importing Font
    - Before: Import the Google font to each HTML page
    - Now: Use @import in one shared CSS page
